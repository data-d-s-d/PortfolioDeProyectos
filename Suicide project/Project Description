This is a particularly special project for me for many reasons. 
I believe this to be a very important subject, but unfortunatelly 
very neglected, even considered taboo. Therefore I also believe 
that talking and sharing information about it is the way out of this.
Main dataset I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
I also used a population dataset as support data: https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.POP.TOTL&country=#
Hope you enjoy.
