# PortfolioDeProyectos
Repository for personal projects
In this portfolio I have several projects: 
- The first one is in SQL about Covid deaths and infections. ðŸ˜·
- The second one is a data cleaning project, also in SQL. ðŸ§¹
- The third one is a project in Python about correlations in the movie industry. ðŸ“½
- The fourth is a SQL project about the correlation between forest felling and global temperature change. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²
- Currently working on a project about suicide. I believe this to be a very important subject, but unfortunatelly very neglected, and even considered taboo as well.
Therefore I also believe that talking and sharing information about it is the way out of the pit. Enjoy! 

Hope you like them!
