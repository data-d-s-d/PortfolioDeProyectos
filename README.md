# PortfolioDeProyectos
Repository for personal projects
In this portfolio I have several projects: 
- The first one is in SQL about Covid deaths and infections. ðŸ˜·
- The second one is a data cleaning project, also in SQL. ðŸ§¹
- The third one is a project in Python about correlations in the movie industry. ðŸ“½
- The fourth is a SQL project about the correlation between forest felling and global temperature change. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²
- Currently working on a project about suicide. I believe this to be a very important subject, but unfortunatelly very neglected, and even considered taboo.
Talking and sharing information about it is the way out of this situation, so I wondered what datasets were out there and found this one: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
I also used a population dataset as support data: https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.POP.TOTL&country=#

Hope you like them!
