In this project I wanted to explore a relatively large dataset of Covid 19, 
so I believed it would be interesting to create queries on an international, 
regional (South America) and local (Argentina) scale of infections. The 
queries made here were used to assemble the visualizations of the Tableau 
Project of Covid 19 displayed previously.
